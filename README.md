## Project Overview
A comprehensive data analytics project demonstrating end-to-end data warehouse implementation and business intelligence analysis using SQL Server. This project showcases dimensional modeling, exploratory data analysis, and advanced SQL techniques for business insights.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build a star schema data warehouse with fact and dimension tables
- Perform comprehensive business intelligence analysis
- Create customer and product performance reports
- Demonstrate advanced SQL analytical functions
- Generate actionable business insights from sales data

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Database**: `DataWarehouseAnalytics`
- **Schema**: `gold` (production-ready analytical layer)

### Tables Structure
```sql
📊 Fact Table:
- fact_sales (order_number, product_key, customer_key, dates, sales_amount, quantity, price)

📋 Dimension Tables:
- dim_customers (customer demographics and details)
- dim_products (product catalog with categories and costs)
```

## 📈 Analysis Categories

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Data profiling and quality assessment
- Dimensional analysis (countries, categories, date ranges)
- Measure exploration (total sales, quantities, pricing)
- Business metrics summary report

### 2. **Magnitude Analysis**
- Revenue distribution across categories
- Customer distribution by geography and demographics
- Product performance by category and subcategory
- Cross-dimensional comparisons

### 3. **Ranking Analysis**
- Top/bottom performing products
- Customer revenue rankings
- Category performance rankings
- Window functions for advanced rankings

### 4. **Time Series Analysis**
- Sales performance over time (yearly, monthly)
- Cumulative analysis with running totals
- Moving averages and trend analysis
- Year-over-year growth comparisons

### 5. **Performance Analysis**
- Current vs. previous year sales comparison
- Performance vs. average benchmarking
- Growth trend identification
- Seasonal pattern analysis

### 6. **Part-to-Whole Analysis**
- Category contribution to total sales
- Market share analysis
- Percentage distribution reports
- Business dependency assessment

### 7. **Data Segmentation**
- Customer segmentation (VIP, Regular, New)
- Product cost range analysis
- Age group categorization
- Performance-based groupings

## 📊 Business Intelligence Reports

### Customer Analytics Report
**Key Metrics:**
- Total orders and sales per customer
- Customer lifetime value
- Recency analysis (months since last order)
- Average order value
- Average monthly spend
- Customer segmentation and age group analysis

### Product Performance Report
**Key Metrics:**
- Revenue performance classification
- Average order rate (AOR)
- Monthly revenue trends
- Product lifecycle analysis
- Category and subcategory performance

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Advanced SQL Techniques Used:
- **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LAG(), LEAD()
- **Aggregate Functions**: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG() with OVER clause
- **Date Functions**: DATETRUNC(), DATEDIFF(), FORMAT()
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Complex multi-level queries
- **CASE Statements**: Dynamic categorization and segmentation
- **JOINs**: Multi-table analysis and data integration
- **Views**: Reusable analytical components

### Data Loading:
- BULK INSERT operations for CSV data ingestion
- Data validation and cleanup procedures
- Truncate and reload patterns

## 📋 Key Business Insights

1. **Revenue Concentration**: Bikes category generates majority of revenue
2. **Geographic Distribution**: US market shows highest item sales volume
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Clear VIP, Regular, and New customer tiers
4. **Product Performance**: Identified top and bottom performing products
5. **Seasonal Trends**: Monthly and yearly sales pattern analysis
6. **Customer Behavior**: Purchase frequency and value patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SQL Server 2019+ (for DATETRUNC function)
- CSV data files in specified directory
- Appropriate file system permissions

### Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository
2. Update file paths in BULK INSERT statements
3. Execute the SQL script in SQL Server Management Studio
4. Verify data loading and run analysis queries

### File Structure

## 📊 Sample Queries

### Top 5 Revenue Generating Products
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) as total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p ON p.product_key = f.product_key
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Customer Segmentation Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_segment,
    COUNT(customer_key) as total_customers
FROM gold.report_customers
GROUP BY customer_segment
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;
```
